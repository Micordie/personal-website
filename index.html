                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>     At the beginning of the Corona Virus pandemic, I started my foray into the world of code.
                        After I felt confident with Python, I decided I wanted to try out something I had been interested 
                        in for a long time: Game Design. <br>
                        <br>After some time working with the Unity Engine and C#, I realized I 
                        had no ability to create game assets of my own. So, I began working with Blender, which created a whole 
                        new passion for art --some of which can be seen in my gallery! Then I was off to college. This is where my 
                        formal Computer Science education started. I am currently studying Computer Science and Game Developement 
                        at the University of Pittsburgh, and will be continuing to hone my skills in the years to come.</p>
